# Efishery Fish Store

this project purpose for test assessment.

this project include SharedCode that can IOS run base logic code with kotlin multiplatform.

for build .framework use this script

```
./gradlew :SharedCode:packForXcode 
```

this not fully working at IOS this SharedCode handle ApiClient with Ktor multiplatform.

I'm sorry, my bad is to much take time for research and learning Kotlin multiplatform because it's really interesting.
this test's not maximal that I can work it.
